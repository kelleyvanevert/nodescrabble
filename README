A simple scrabble game in javascript using nodejs, vows and express.

Core scrabble game @ lib/scrabble.js
* Run unit tests: vows test/scrabble-test.js
* ..or test/play manually: node terminal.js
I created a symbolic link in node_modules/scrabble.js for simple require("scrabble")
 usage from any file in this or any subdirectory of this directory;
 and a symbolic link in public/scrabble.js for the webserver.

Run the webserver: node server.js

TODO
- UI sidebar: history, score table, chat
- Interaction: ask blank letter dialog, reject?
- Automatic game removal after T days of not being modified
(- Browser compatibility -- firefox works I think, so I'm happy.)
- Testing!
